<h2> **DATA FRAME**</h2>
---
<p>
A data frame is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column.
</p>
</div>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>




Following are the characteristics of a data frame.

+ The column names should be non-empty.
+ The row names should be unique.
+ The data stored in a data frame can be of numeric, factor or character type.
+ Each column should contain same number of data items.

## Creating a data frame

```{r}
data=data.frame(
  enrollment.no=01:10,
  first.name=c("Biman","Prapti","Dipjyoti","Rashmi","Debojit",
               "Rocky","Rajesh","Semantika","Dhriti","Priyanka"),
  last.name=c("Deka","Kakati","Chahariya","Bhuyan","Barua",
              "Baglary","Bodo","Chakraborty","Chakraborty","Agarwal"),
  cgpa=c(6.5,7.2,6.1,8.5,6.0,5.2,5.5,9.0,8.75,8.0),
  gender=c("male","female","male","female","male","male",
           "male","female","female","female"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
print(data)
```
The structure of the data frame can be seen by using `str()` function.

```{r}
str(data)
```

> Note: By default R consider any variable in a data frame with character values as a factor. To override this we use `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`

The statistical summary and nature of the data can be obtained by applying `summary()` function.

```{r}
summary(data)
```

## Extract Data from Data Frame

Extract specific column from a data frame using column name.
```{r}
names = data.frame(data$first.name,data$last.name)
names
```

Extract rows from a data frame

```{r}
temp=data[8:10,]
temp
```

We can extract both rows and column simultaneously

```{r}
result=data[8:10,2:3]
result
```

## Expand Data Frame
A data frame can be expanded by adding columns and rows.

## Add Column
Just add the column vector using a new column name.

```{r}
data$specialization=c("OR","Demography","OR","OR","Demography",
                      "Demography","OR","Demography","OR","Demography")

data
```
## Add Row
To add more rows permanently to an existing data frame, we need to bring in the new rows in the same structure as the existing data frame and use the `rbind()` function.

In the example below we create a data frame with new rows and merge it with the existing data frame to create the final data frame.

```{r}
data1=data.frame(
  enrollment.no=11:15,
  first.name=c("Kankan","Reyhan","Simi","Arpita","Chandan"),
  last.name=c("Sarma","Ali","Mahanta","Ganguly","Deka"),
  cgpa=c(7.8,6.5,5.0,5.5,5.8),
  gender=c("male","male","female","female","male"),
  specialization=c("OR","Demography","OR","OR","Demography"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
data=rbind(data,data1)
print(data)
```

> in R we use `rbind` and `cbind` to combine two or more vectors row wise or column wise respectively

Another simple way of creating a data frame is:

```{r}
a=1:10
b=21:30
data2=cbind(a,b)
data2=as.data.frame(data2)
data2
data2$total=a+b
data2$average=(a+b)/2
data2
c=c(11,31,11+31,21)
data2=rbind(data2,c)
```

## Reading External Files

In R, we can read data from files stored outside the R environment. We can also write data into files which will be stored and accessed by the operating system. R can read and write into various file formats like csv, excel, xml etc.

In this chapter we will learn to read data from a csv file and then write data into a csv file. The file should be present in current working directory so that R can read it. Of course we can also set our own directory and read files from there.

>
You can check which directory the R workspace is pointing to using the `getwd()` function. You can also set a new working directory using `setwd()` function.

The csv file is a text file in which the values in the columns are separated by a comma. Let's consider the following data present in the file named input.csv.

You can create this file using **Windows Notepad** by copying and pasting this data. Save the file as input.csv using the save As All files(*.*) option in notepad.

```
id,name,salary,start_date,dept
1,Rick,623.3,2012-01-01,IT
2,Dan,515.2,2013-09-23,Operations
3,Michelle,611,2014-11-15,IT
4,Ryan,729,2014-05-11,HR
5,Gary,843.25,2015-03-27,Finance
6,Nina,578,2013-05-21,IT
7,Simon,632.8,2013-07-30,Operations
8,Guru,722.5,2014-06-17,Finance
```

### Reading a CSV File

Following is a simple example of `read.csv()` function to read a CSV file available in your current working directory âˆ’

```{r}
data3 <- read.csv("files/input.csv")
data3
```

By default the read.csv() function gives the output as a data frame. Once we read data in a data frame, we can apply all the functions applicable to data frames.

## Writing into a CSV File

R can create csv file form existing data frame. The write.csv() function is used to create the csv file. This file gets created in the working directory.

```{r}
output.data=write.csv(data,"Output.csv")
data4=read.csv("Output.csv")
data4
```
Once the above code is executed, you will see that a new `.csv` file is being created in your default R folder.

Here the column X comes from the data set newper. This can be dropped using additional parameter `row.names = FALSE` while writing the file.

```{r}
output.data=write.csv(data,"Output.csv",row.names = FALSE)
data4=read.csv("Output.csv")
data4
```
