<h2> **WHAT IS R ?**</h2>
---
<p>
R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting. R was created by **Ross Ihaka** and **Robert Gentleman** at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the R Development Core Team. R is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems like Linux, Windows and Mac. This programming language was named R, based on the first letter of first name of the two R authors (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka), and partly a play on the name of the Bell Labs Language S.

<br/>


R is a _free-to-use_ and _open-sourced_ programming language that is  widely used  for statistical as well as various Socio-Economical studies.
  
In this course we will be using two different applications,
  
  + R and
  + R Studio
  
## Setting Up R   
  R can be downloaded from the following link:  
  <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>
  
  
  _"RStudio is a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and a variety of robust tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and managing your workspace."_
  
  R Studio can be downloaded from the following link:  
  <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>
  
  Though we will use R studio for our calculations, but R is essential for proper functioning of R studio.
  
  R Studio by default open 4 different windows.
  
  * Script
  * Console
  * Plots
  * History
  
  
```{r, out.width = "600px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RSetup.png")
```

The **Script** window can be considered as a notepad where we can write our codes which can be edited according to requirement. Another advantage of writing our code in script is that we can save our script as a text file with `.R` extension. 

The **Console** window is where the actual programming is executed and the outcomes are shown.

We can type `Ctrl + Enter` to run a particular code from the script window without typing it in the console window.

## An Advance Calculator

R Can be think as an advance calculator which can handle all basic calculations:

```{r,comment=""}
2+6
3-1
2*6
18/2
2^4
```

## Arithmetic operators In R

> `+`   Addition  
 `-`   Subtraction  
 `*`   Multiplication  
 `/`   Division  
 `^`   to-the-power
  

There are some pre-defined functions in R that can be used to do some other arithmetic operations. For example:

```{r}
sum(2,3,4,5,6,8) # will give the sum of all the numbers

factorial(5)  # will give the value of 5!

sqrt(16)      # will give the square root of 16

abs(-5)       # will give the absolute value of the number

exp(5)        # will calculate exponential of 5

log(2)        # log of 2 to the base e

log10(100)    # log of 100 to the base 10

# will round off the number/vector to given number of decimal places.
round(3.2666666,2)    
          
# truncates the decimal part of a number/vector.
trunc(3.266666)   

letters      # the vector of small letters

LETTERS      # the vector of CAPITAL letters.

letters[1:4] # Selecting the first 4 small letters.

LETTERS[1:4] # Selecting the first four capital letters.
