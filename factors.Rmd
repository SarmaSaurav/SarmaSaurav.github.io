  <h2>**FACTORS**</h2>
  <p>Factors are the data objects which are used to categorize the data and store it as levels. They can store both strings and integers. They are useful in the columns which have a limited number of unique values. Like "Male, "Female" and True, False etc. They are useful in data analysis for statistical modeling.

Factors are created using the `factor ()` function by taking a vector as input.

<font size="4" color="green"> Let us consider the following example</font>

```{r}
data <- c("East","West","East","North","North","East","West",
          "West","West","East","North")
factor_data=factor(data)
factor_data
```
By default, the factor function assign the levels alphabetically. We can change this using `levels=()` command.

```{r}
data <- c("East","West","East","North","North","East","West",
          "West","West","East","North")
factor_data=factor(data, levels = c("North","East","West"))
factor_data
```

We can also convert a numeric vector into factor:

```{r}
num_data=c(0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1)
factor_data=factor(num_data, labels = c("Male","Female"))
factor_data
```

### Generating Factor Levels
We can generate factor levels by using the gl() function. It takes two integers as input which indicates how many levels and how many times each level.

```
gl(n, k, labels)
```
Following is the description of the parameters used âˆ’

* __n__ is a integer giving the number of levels.

* __k__ is a integer giving the number of replications.

* __labels__ is a vector of labels for the resulting factor levels.

```{r}
factor_data=gl(2,8, labels = c("Male","Female"))
factor_data
```

Another example of Factor is:

```{r}
# Generating 100 random numbers between 1 and 100
data = sample(1:100,100)
# Generating an empty vector of size 100.
result=mat.or.vec(100,1)
for (i in 1:100) {
  if(data[i]<30){
    result[i]=0
    }
  else if(data[i]>=30 && data[i]<45){
    result[i]=1
  }
  else if(data[i]>=45 && data[i]<60){
    result[i]=2
  }
  else {
    result[i]=3
    }
}

f_result=factor(result, labels = c("Fail", "Third Div", "Second Div", "First Div"))
str(f_result)
summary(f_result)
plot(f_result)

```
